# arduino-midi-player-mkll
the successor of the midi player,
you must have the sd fat library installed and
you must use the modified version of the md file library

to get the program to run you need to put the .mid file in the sd card directory (they must not be on a folder)
the title of the midi file must be less than 20 caracters long
then have fun
